        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, green chilies, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Cover and let it marinate for at least 1 hour (preferably overnight in the refrigerator).</li>
            <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak it in water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add whole cloves, cardamoms, bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, cumin seeds, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the soaked and drained rice to the boiling water. Cook until the rice is 70% done (it should still have a bite to it). Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add the marinated chicken along with the marinade. Cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is browned and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low. Spread half of the partially cooked rice over the chicken in an even layer.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle half of the fried onions, chopped coriander, and mint leaves over the rice.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining rice and layer it with the remaining fried onions, coriander, and mint. You can also place boiled eggs on top if using.</li>
            <li>Drizzle a little ghee on top if desired.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot tightly with a lid. You can seal it with dough or a clean kitchen towel to trap the steam.</li>
            <li>Cook on low heat for 30-40 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking.</li>
            <li>Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork. Serve hot, garnished with additional fried onions and fresh herbs, along with raita or a salad on the side.</li>
        </ol>
